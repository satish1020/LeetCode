<!-- Prefix Sum -->
Prefix sum is a technique that can be used on arrays (of numbers). The idea is to create an array prefix where prefix[i] is the sum of all elements up to the index i (inclusive). For example, given nums = [5, 2, 1, 6, 3, 8], we would have prefix = [5, 7, 8, 14, 17, 25].

When a subarray starts at index 0, it is considered a "prefix" of the array. A prefix sum represents the sum of all prefixes.

Prefix sums allow us to find the sum of any subarray in 
ùëÇ
(
1
)
O(1). If we want the sum of the subarray from i to j (inclusive), then the answer is prefix[j] - prefix[i - 1], or prefix[j] - prefix[i] + nums[i] if you don't want to deal with the out of bounds case when i = 0.

This works because prefix[i - 1] is the sum of all elements before index i. When you subtract this from the sum of all elements up to index j, you are left with the sum of all elements starting at index i and ending at index j, which is exactly what we are looking for.


3,6,2,,8,1,4,1,5

prefix sum of above array:
3,9,11,19,20,24,25,30

In the above image, we want to find the sum of the subarray from index 3 to 6..

If you take all the elements up until the end of the subarray (of index 6) and subtract all the elements before index 3 (which is index 2), you have the subarray.

With a prefix sum, we can find the sum of index 6 i.e 25 and upto index 2 i.e 11 in constant time and take their difference to find the sum of the subarray as 14.

Building a prefix sum is very simple. Here's some pseudocode:

Given an array nums,

// note in the below pseudo code prefix.length is 1 and it keeps increasing as we keep appending.
Pseudo code:
prefix = [nums[0]] 
for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++)
    prefix.append(nums[i] + prefix[prefix.length - 1])

Initially, we start with just the first element. Then we iterate with i starting from index 1. At any given point, the last element of prefix will represent the sum of all the elements in the input up to but not including index i. So we can add that value plus the current value to the end of prefix and continue to the next element.

A prefix sum is a great tool whenever a problem involves sums of a subarray. It only costs 
O(n) to build but allows all future subarray queries to be ùëÇ(1), so it can usually improve an algorithm's time complexity by a factor of O(n), where 
n is the length of the array. Let's look at some examples.

Building a prefix sum is a form of pre-processing. Pre-processing is a useful strategy in a variety of problems where we store pre-computed data in a data structure before running the main logic of our algorithm. While it takes some time to pre-process, it's an investment that will save us a huge amount of time during the main parts of the algorithm.

<!-- Git hub creating personal and work configs

 https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent

a. ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "cvsatish.net@gmail.com"
b. step a prompts for a path always choose :¬† ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_<some name if first time dont¬†give _name leave it> in our case we gave id_ed25519_personal.
c. And above command after giving successfully¬†given path its asks for a pass phrase give any thing in this case we had given 12345678
d. after above steps now generated pub file we need to add using below command¬†¬† ¬†¬†ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personale. after creation copy the certificate using below command¬†¬†
¬† ¬† ¬†¬†cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal.pub | pbcopyf.¬† AFter that the copied ssh key ned to enter in the gihub¬†go to github->topRight->dropdown->settings->SSH Key and GPG Keys -> Add New Key -> copy your key and save
g. After that please go to your config file in path ~/.SSH/CONFIG, create a domain for your personal¬†and give the path to the .pub file in ~/.ssh/.id_ed25519.pub file
Host github.com
¬† AddKeysToAgent yes
¬† UseKeychain yes
¬† IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal

h. test the ssh connecting¬†from your terminal¬†like below¬† ¬† ssh -T git@github.com

vi ~/.ssh/config

to see configs in laptop vi ~/.ssh/config:
it gives list of ssh configs as below,
Host github.intuit.com
¬† AddKeysToAgent yes
¬† UseKeychain yes
¬† IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519


Created a new personal¬† config:
Host github.com
¬† AddKeysToAgent yes
¬† UseKeychain yes
¬† IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_personal -->
